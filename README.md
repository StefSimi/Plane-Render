# Plane Render

## About

A project using OpenGL/ GLUT that simulates the flight of a plane throughout different times of day and meteorological conditions in a 3D space.

## Elements

There are multiple elements being rendered in the scene:<br>
-The main object in the scene is the plane. The camera can be moved around it;<br>
-Clouds will be randomly generated around the plane, moving at different speeds. These will disappear if they get too far from the plane; <br>
-Rain and snow will periodically appear. These are created by spawning in numerous points and giving them a downwards trajectory; <br>
-A day-night cycle exists to make the scene more realistic. The plane is suibably illuminated to account for these changes; <br>
